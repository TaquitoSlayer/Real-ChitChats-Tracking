As per [this page](https://support.chitchats.com/support/solutions/articles/47000426692), ChitChats and their partner Asendia first give out a tracking number that will be updated only after the handoff is done to the courier of the country. However, as per [this page](https://support.chitchats.com/support/solutions/articles/47000426372-which-countries-does-asendia-ship-to-), they eventually go to the following Postal operators which otherwise give better tracking information.

Being a seller on eBay for almost 10 years now, having proper tracking information is a huge thing, and since I've started doing international shipments, there's a gaping hole in this for eBay sellers since Asendia doesn't offer timely tracking information, which in turn keeps your customers hanging wondering where the hell their package is, which then has you battling cases when you do decide to use them. Below is 20 cases in only 1 month alone of using Asendia with ChitChats (yep, i had 0 issues when staying within Canada and the US):<br />

Now in theory, it's not ChitChats fault, they're just a middle man, it's really Asendia's fault for not scraping their shit better for other Postal operators when the handoff is done from one partner to another.

However as an eBay seller, the responsibility of the package is completely up to you, and with delays being up to 75 business days with international shipments. Regardless of how you notify your customers, they're still going to complain so that's why I made this script to help.

The script's purpose to grab the proper tracking number from Asendia once given and update tracking number respective to your Competed Sales, that way, the customer can just see the updates going forward from there instead of Asendia's crappy tracking.
